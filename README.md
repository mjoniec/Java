Think on business purpose of this project ...

# 1. Technology agnostic backend architect experience - Java instead of Net

- Spring, Http Api, SpringHttpApi_HelloWorld
- run in cmd: mvnw spring-boot:run
- open in web browser: http://localhost:8080/hello or http://localhost:8080/hello?name=Amy
- Some middleware equivalent In Java? Spring layers vs DDD - https://www.petrikainulainen.net/software-development/design/the-biggest-flaw-of-spring-web-applications/
- HATEOAS + richardson maturity
- JPA? ORM autmatically implementing repository by interface methods name...

# 2. Security:

-	JWT, Jwt bearer
-	SSO â€“ Single sign-on
-	OIDC - Open ID Connect
-	Auth, OAuth 2.0 (I saw some spring template for client / server)
- Cookies
