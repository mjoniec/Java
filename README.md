# Why
- Backend Technology Agnostic experience - Java instead of Net
- exposed through Spring Http Api
- MongoDB Change Streams - for some reactive functionality
- Think on business purpose of this project ... and then rename

# Run
- cmd: mvnw spring-boot:run
- browser: http://localhost:8080/hello or http://localhost:8080/hello?name=Amy

# ideas
- Some middleware equivalent In Java? Spring layers vs DDD - https://www.petrikainulainen.net/software-development/design/the-biggest-flaw-of-spring-web-applications/
- HATEOAS + richardson maturity
- JPA? ORM autmatically implementing repository by interface methods name...
- DNA 10.03 - rewatch for specific technical ideas and targets: 3 levels of reactiveness, 
- business idea for prep crude data, top 10 on some filter then slower top 10k in another but still faster than without reactive streams ...
- why java for x and not net core ? - better reactive technology in java (add proff), backend technology agnostic problem solver, add this to wiki or sth ...
